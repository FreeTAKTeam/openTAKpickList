## TAK Product Center Plugins - CIV (USG)
These plugins are available from the TAK Product Center at [tak.gov](https://tak.gov). With updated _actual_ descriptions from TPC. As there are some inaccuracies on the original pull. Plugins names are in **bold**.

* **ADSB** - ADSB is to allow for a FlightAware USB stick to provide input into ATAK and allow for aircraft equipped with ADS-B transponders to be displayed on the map. The map can be conveniently panned and zoomed to aircraft locations and this same data to be pumped back into a TAK server or local mesh network.
* **ARES-N** - Augmented Reality System for Navigation (ARES-N) capability is a suite of APKs (ARES-N, ATAK, AR Repeater and VNS) to deliver a hands-free, heads-up route with turn-by-turn navigation. Originally funded by the Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office (CTTSO) and directed by end-users from AFSOC. 
* **Beartooth** - The purpose of the Beartooth ATAK plug-in is to use the Beartooth radios as a network transport for simple situation awareness data (e.g., PLI, Chat, PTT audio). One Beartooth device with a secondary network (e.g., TAK Server) will proxy blue force tracks it receives over Beartooth to the secondary network.
* **Chokepoint** analyzes road networks to determine the minimum resources required to isolate a region, and can be used to setup perimeters for force protection, threat containment, sensor deployment, etc.
* ATAK **Cloud** Owncloud/FTP server integration. Allows users to upload and download files and data packages to and from a remote file server.
* **Compass Nav** tool provides access to the legacy compass tool in ATAK.  This plug-in will also override the functionality of the Quick Nav tool.
* **Data Synchronization** plug-in is used to synchronize multiple ATAK devices involved in the same exercise or event. This plug-in should be utilized in conjunction with the latest TAK Server version and no earlier than 1.3.3+. TAK Server stores all data for a "mission" in a server-side database. 
* **DSM Manager** allows integration of user generated elevation products such as Pix4D elevation geotiff and shows coverage.
* **ESChat** plugin only an on screen PTT button widget to initiate PTT calls in the ESChat app."
* The Execution Checklist (**ExCheck**) plug-in allows users to monitor and update the status of a shared checklist that is hosted out on a TAK Server.  Each checklist is an instance of a template that defines several tasks to be completed.
* **GEEP** provides access to GEEP (Google Earth Enterprise) offline imagery and terrain exports.
* **GEO TAK CAM** is a camera plug-in used to capture images with geospatial metadata. This currently exists as both an organic ATAK plug-in and as a separate application. Both function the same way but serve different use cases.
* **goTenna** ATAK plug-in is to use goTenna Pro X radios to create a tactical mesh network for situational awareness data (e.g., PLI such as location, points, routes, etc.) and chat when off-grid (see www.gotennapro.com for more details). A goTenna user with a connection to a secondary network (e.g., TAK Server via LTE) will proxy blue force tracks, points and chat it receives from goTenna to the secondary network via the End User Device (EUD).  Each ATAK version (e.g., 3.8, 3.10, MIL, CIV, etc.) requires a different goTenna ATAK plug-in.
* **GRG Builder** is a tool for creating GRG (KMZ) files using a snapshot of high-resolution map imagery with map items, file overlays, and optional snapshot information, map scale, compass, crosshair and an MGRS grid.
* **GvLF Streamer** a DTED Streamer that provides an interface for downloading compressed DTED data from a TAK server with GvLF installed.
* **Heads Up Display (HUD)** plug-in is used to connect ATAK to HUD devices. The plug-in allows the user to set filters to specify what data should be transmitted to the HUD. Navigational routes may also be transmitted to the HUD. The plug-in provides a start "Sync" button to send data to the HUD, based on the user filters.
* The **Last Known Location** plug-in logs all user's location details connected to the same network. If a user drops off the network, that user can be queried using the plug-in and view the last location it sent out before the user dropped off. 
* **Milestone** gives the ability to query a Milestone server and start a live video feed.
* **OCEUS VPN** tells ATAK that the state of the VPN has changed and trigger a refresh across all of the network interface.
* **Pager** is a tool for no notice callouts and for tracking personnel accountability to events within or in proximity to a defined location.
* ATAK **Quantized Mesh** elevation data integration using the specification provided by Cesium.
* **QuickChat** plug-in integrates with the messaging system of ATAK to allow displaying a large dialog banner when certain/specific messages are received or messages from high priority users. High priority users are determined based on a predefined list built into the plug-in with the ability to add or remove from the list later. 
* **Quick Log** allows you to take and store quick notes such as reminders or observations you've made that you need to remember. TAK sticky notes.
* **TAK Chat** plug-in is used to chat securely with other systems via XMPP.  Since XMPP is a standard, this plug-in can chat with other applications and platforms, including non TAK products.
* **Track Export** plug-in adds support for exporting data including track logs to various formats including KML/Z, GPX and others.
* The **UAS Tool** is a plug-in that provides integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) for enhanced Situational Awareness (SA) and telemetry data, Full Motion Video (FMV), and command and control (C2).
* **Vehicle Navigation System (VNS**) plug-in performs three major functions. First, it provides three different route planner implementations to ATAK; Google Directions, PAR Government's private routing server and offline routing. Second, it augments ATAK route navigation with turn-by-turn directions and dynamic re-routing. The last major function is an emergency quick navigation, allowing route navigation to be immediately re-routed to a pre-planned point.
* **WAVE** plug-in provides secure Voice over IP (VoIP) using Motorola WAVE technology. This plug-in allows ATAK users to communicate via WAVE without leaving the ATAK application. A WAVE Proxy server supporting the "ATAK Wave license" is required.
* **Wx Report** plug-in provides ATAK users with the capabilities to query for the weather forecast at a given location and add weather overlays to the map. The weather query displays current conditions (NOAA/Yahoo data), as well as the 10-day projected forecast.
* The **ICE** Voice Plug-in is a serverless voice software application that allows push to talk communication between teams over IP and MANET networks, integration and interoperability with Combat Net Radios via direct connect (Silvus, Trellisware)or donor attached via a radio gateway.  The next release will feature the creation of ad hoc voice channels for one to one or one to many based.  The ad hoc channels can be created from the contact list, GeoChat or by creating a geo-fence on the map application. The ICE Voice Plug-in will also integrate with the COTS ICE Server as well as the COTS ICE Desktop and Mobile client.
* The **Munter** Tool is used to calculate the time required to traverse a route based on the distance traveled, travel method, and elevation gain/loss.
* **Neon** plug-in provides GPS-denied tracking using TRX Neon Tracking Devices and the Neon Location Service.  The Neon Location Service combines inertial motion, Android GPS locations and externally connected device locations to provide a continuous location and altitude for the ATAK interface.
* Provides a **SIP** capability for ATAK based on native Android libraries specifically for Voice over IP servers such as Asterisk and FreeSIP.
* **Somewear**’s compact satellite hotspot and ATAK plugin provide reliable BLOS communication and situational awareness between personnel, assets, interagency partners and operations centers. Somewear supports 100% global coverage across ground, aerial and maritime operations. [https://www.somewearlabs.com/government](https://www.somewearlabs.com/government)
